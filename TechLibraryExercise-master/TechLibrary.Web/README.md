### Considerations
This development exercise is intended to be a ~ 4-hour exercise (+/-).  Even though the current scope does not represent an enterprise application, please approach your application design with supporting such a production application in mind. 


Agile teams strive for maintainable, quality code that will be evaluated at build time in a Continuous Integration pipeline – please apply all applicable techniques and practices to this project towards these goals. 

If you find areas that you would choose to refactor, please do so and note your thought process behind the refactoring.
